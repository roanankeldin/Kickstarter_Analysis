# Kickstarter Analysis
# Overview of Project
  By exploring our data from various kickstarter campaigns to fundraise, the client wanted to find out which time of year correlated to the highest amount of fundraising for theater productions specifically.
# Analysis and Challenges
  The best way to analyze this data set was with the visual functions in Excel. I created a pivot table which I then used to create two line charts. There was an excess of data which made sorting through what was relevent a challenge. 
# Results
  Based on the analysis, I would tell the client to fundraise for their play during the summer months. July would be the best month in the summer.
